        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>

        <li>vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
        <li>2 serrano peppers, sliced into 1/4-inch pieces</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cumin powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chile powder, or less to taste</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>6 fresh curry leaves, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons red chile-garlic paste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ginger paste</li>
        <li>5 drops red food coloring, or more as needed</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>¾ cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place chicken in a medium bowl. Add egg, cornstarch, 1/2 of the minced garlic, 1/2 of the minced ginger, salt, and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper. Mix until chicken is completely coated.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep skillet and fry chicken pieces until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 7 to 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Set fried chicken aside</li>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a second skillet over medium heat. Add cumin seeds and cook until crackling, about 1 minute. Add remaining garlic, remaining ginger, serrano peppers, cumin, chile powder, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, and salt. Add curry leaves and stir to combine. Add chile-garlic paste, ginger paste, and red food coloring. Stir to create a paste. Add water to thin paste slightly</li>
        <li>Add fried chicken to the the skillet and toss to coat thoroughly. Stir in cilantro</li>
    </ol>
